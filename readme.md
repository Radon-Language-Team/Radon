# Radium Compiler

Radium is my own attempt at creating a programming language. <br>
Radium is a compiled language and is designed to be simple and easy to use.

The compiler is written in TypeScript and is compiled to JavaScript. <br>
The JavaScript code is then run using Node.js. <br>
I am aware that this is not the most efficient way to create a compiler, but it is the easiest way for me to get started. <br>
I am planning to rewrite the compiler in the V Programming Language once it is more stable.

This is a hobby project and is not intended to be used in production. <br>
The goal of this project is to learn more about compilers and programming languages.<br>
One day, the compiler itself might be written in Radium. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Features

- _nothing yet_ (Working on return statements)

_This is a work in progress and more features will be added soon._

## Example

```radium
let x = 5
let y = 10
let z = x + y
return (z) // Prints 15
```

## Usage

To compile a Radium file, use the following command:

```bash
npm run compile <file>
```
