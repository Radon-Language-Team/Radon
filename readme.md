<p>
  <strong>A statically-typed compiled programming language
  </strong>
</p>
</div>

> [!NOTE]
> Clone the repository and then build the radon binary using the `build_bin.sh` script.
> This requires the `V` Compiler to be installed. This builds both the Linux and Windows binaries.
> `cd` into the `bin` directory and run the `radon` binary.
> You should now be able to run the Radon REPL.

## Symbolic Link

When you have built the binary, you can create a symbolic link to the binary in the `bin` directory.
This allows you to run the `radon` command from anywhere in the terminal.
All you have to do is run the REPL with admin permissions and then run the `link` command
Everything is done for you automatically.
