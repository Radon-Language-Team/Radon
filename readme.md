# Radium Compiler

Radium is my own attempt at creating a programming language. <br>
Radium is a compiled language and is designed to be simple and easy to use.

## Features

- [x] Basic arithmetic
- [x] Variables
- [x] If-statements

_This is a work in progress and more features will be added soon._

## Example

```radium
let x = 5
let y = 10
let z = x + y
out (z) // Prints 15
```

## Usage

To compile a Radium file, use the following command:

```bash
npm run compile <file>
```
