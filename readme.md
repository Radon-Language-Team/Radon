# Radon Compiler

Radon is my own attempt at creating a programming language. <br>
Radon is a compiled language and is designed to be simple and easy to use.

The compiler is written in TypeScript and is compiled to JavaScript. <br>
The JavaScript code is then run using Node.js. <br>
I am aware that this is not the most efficient way to create a compiler, but it is the easiest way for me to get started. <br>
I am planning to rewrite the compiler in the V Programming Language once it is more stable.

This is a hobby project and is not intended to be used in production. <br>
The goal of this project is to learn more about compilers and programming languages.<br>
One day, the compiler itself might be written in Radon. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Features

- [x] Variables (Only integers for now)

_This is a work in progress and more features will be added soon._

## Example

```Radon
var x: $int = 5;
log (x);
```

_In Radon, all variables must be declared with a type. The only type available right now is integers._ <br>
_The type declaration is not optional and must be included when declaring a variable._ <br>
_The syntax for declaring a variable is `var <variable_name>: <type> = <value>;`_

## Usage

To compile a Radon file, use the following command:

```bash
npm run compile <file>
```
